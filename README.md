- 👋 Hi, I’m @tsdamas
- 👀 I’m interested in learning front-end development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and CSS. I started two weeks ago. What I can say is that it has been addictive.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project actually. I'm passionate about learning new things and helping others.
