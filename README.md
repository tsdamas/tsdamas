- 👋 Hi, I’m @tsdamas
- 👀 I’m interested in learning software development.
- 🌱 My coding journey started in 2021. What I can say is that it has been addictive. Since my first hello world, I have proggramed in Javascript, C, C++ and Java. Recently I discover that my true passion lies on react native, working on API integration and automation. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project actually. I'm passionate about learning new things and helping others.
